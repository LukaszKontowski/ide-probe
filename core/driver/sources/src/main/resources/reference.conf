    version {

      // `release` is the "Version" and connected `build` is the "Build Number" of IntelliJ IDEA version. Both should
      // be provided and they should match. You can search for proper string pairs here:
      // https://www.jetbrains.com/intellij-repository/releases/ under "com.jetbrains.intellij.idea" heading.
      // If you want to change the default intellij version, provide both parameters in your .conf file.

      // `format` stands for the file format (file extension). You can choose, which type should be downloaded.
      // By default, ".zip" distributions of IntelliJ IDEA are downloaded. Non-default supported format is ".dmg".
      // Other formats are not supported. You can choose only one format.
      format = ".zip"
      # format = ".dmg"

    // Use `path` config with proper path if you want to use an existing Intellij instead of downloading a version.
    // Example path from IntelliJ installed on macOs:
    # path = "/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA CE.app/Contents"

  }

  // `workspace` is for `Option[org.virtuslab.ideprobe.config.WorkspaceConfig]` - default None,
  // hence comments added as a reference. You can specify the workspace by using the below configurations.
  # workspace {

  // First option is to use a Default workspace - by just specifying `probe.workspace.path` with a valid string.
  //
  // `probe.workspace.path` can point to:
  // a) a directory on the filesystem:
  // `probe.workspace.path = "file://home/foo/bar"`
  // b) a directory within a jar:
  // `probe.workspace.path = "jar:file://foo.jar!/bar/baz"`
  // c) a directory on the classpath:
  // `probe.workspace.path = "classpath:/foo/bar"`
  // d) an online resource (http/https) - which can be for example a github repository as below:
  //
  #   path = "https://github.com/VirtusLab/git-machete.git"

  // If `probe.workspace.path` is set and points to a git repository - you can choose one of three additional options:
  // `branch`, `tag` or `commit` - to specify the reference which should be checked out on the workspace setup.
  // Only one of them can be specified. You can as well not use any of these 3 options - in such scenario the default
  // branch will be checked out just like with a plain `git clone` command. Examples below:
  //
  #   branch = "develop"
  #   tag = "v0.41.0"
  #   commit = "a1861fc3b70588acfa171000eb365bf75c143472"

  // Another option is to use an Existing workspace by passing a proper path to its directory
  // - use only `existing` config. In this case, `probe.workspace.path` MUST NOT be defined.
  // `probe.workspace.existing` can be used for scenarios where you want to reuse an existing workspace instead of
  // copying a workspace each time when tests run. It might be beneficial for big projects / repos.
  //
  #   existing = "/Users/my_username/code/my_repository"

  # }

  // `resolvers` is for `org.virtuslab.ideprobe.config.DependenciesConfig.Resolvers` - default values below
  resolvers {

    // `intellij.repositories` contain patterns which should be resolved by ide-probe to download proper IntelliJ IDEA
    // edition (Community or Ultimate) from proper intelliJ repository. Words inside square brackets
    // are parts of the pattern that are replaced with proper values before download attempt. Current replacements
    // are as follows:
    // "[format]" -> value from `probe.intellij.version.format` (".zip" by default)
    // "[revision]" -> value from `probe.intellij.version.release` - or from `probe.intellij.version.build` if `release` not found
    // "[build]" -> value from `probe.intellij.version.build`
    // "[version]" -> value from `probe.intellij.version.release` - or from `probe.intellij.version.build` if `release` not found
    //
    // If you want to use the Ultimate edition, replace "ideaIC" occurences with "ideaIU" in your config file. Community
    // edition ("ideaIC") is the default one.
    //
    // You can also add your custom intellij repository on top of the 4 default repositories, so that ide-probe will
    // first try using the IntelliJs downloaded from your repository if present. If ide-probe doesn't find the IntelliJ
    // distribution in your repository, it will use the default 4 repositories listed below. To achieve that, specify
    // your custom repository pattern and add the `official` or `default` keyword on another line. Example below:
    // intellij.repositories = [
    //   "file:///"${HOME}"/.my_intellij_idea_downloads/[revision]/ideaIC-[revision][format]",
    //   official
    // ]
    //
    intellij.repositories = [
        "https://download.jetbrains.com/idea/nightly/ideaIC-[revision].portable[format]",

      ]

    // `plugins.repository.uri` is the URI of the plugin repository. Use this config if you want to use a non-standard
    // plugin repository. The standard one defined below:
    plugins.repository.uri = "https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/download"

    // `jbr.repositories` contains patterns for JBR versions which should be downloaded and used for tests.
    // ide-probe replaces words in square brackets with replacements as follows:
    // "[major]" -> the "major" part of the JBR release's version number - e.g. "17.0.4" from "17.0.4b469.53"
    // "[minor]" -> the "minor" part of the JBR release's version number - e.g. "b469.53" from "17.0.4b469.53"
    // "[platform]" -> value connected to the detected OS - "linux", "osx" or "windows"
    //
    // The `jbr_dcevm` pattern applies only to versions of IntelliJ older than 2022.2 release, whereas
    // `jbr` pattern applies to newer versions where DCEVM is bundled by default.
    // Another important note: currently we are using only JBR packages with `x64` architecture support. During tests
    // it turned out that using `aarch64` packages on processors with `aarch64` architecture (Mac M1 Pro chip) results
    // in "Cannot load JVM bundle:" error. For some reason only `x64` packages work well (both for `x64` and `aarch64`
    // processor architectures). Hence `x64` should stay hardcoded in the `jbr.repositories` elements.
    jbr.repositories = [
        "https://cache-redirector.jetbrains.com/intellij-jbr/jbr_dcevm-[major]-[platform]-x64-b[minor].tar.gz",
