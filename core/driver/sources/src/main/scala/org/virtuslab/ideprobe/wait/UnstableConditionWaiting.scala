/**
 * Extension of basic waiting logic for unstable conditions.
 *
 * Problem: If for example we were waiting for all background tasks to finish, with basic waiting, the check might
 * happen when all tasks completed, but after a moment another task might start, triggering other tasks etc. Generally
 * many background tasks may appear and disappear during e.g. project import, and there may be short periods without
 * tasks at all, which doesn't mean that the import is complete.
 *
 * Algorithm: The algorithm checks the wait condition periodically, like in `BasicWaiting`, when it seems like condition
 * is met and waiting would be done, there is an extra ensure period. It has constant length, defined by `ensurePeriod`
 * parameter. During this period with frequency specified by `ensureFrequency`, the condition is checked. If it holds
 * through whole ensure period, the waiting is complete, if at any point it turns out it does not hold, the algorithm
 * goes back to the basic waiting. To give more detail, the example values of parameters may explain it more.
 * `basicCheckFrequency` would be 5 seconds, this will handle most of waiting for long tasks that last for minutes.
 * Then, if waiting seems to be complete, algorithm would trigger 2 seconds of `ensurePeriod` with `ensureFrequency` of
 * 50 millis. This means that tasks will be probed for 2 seconds every 50 millis to reduce the chance that some task
 * would "avoid" being noticed. If anything is detected, algorithm goes back to waiting every 5 seconds, otherwise
 * waiting completes.
